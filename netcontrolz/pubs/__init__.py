"""
We have made an effort to recreate the main results of many papers in the network control literature. These have been selected both opportunistically (which are easier, immediate, etc) and also based on need. We endeavor to continue adding to this list over time. Many results rely on large datasets or large-scale computations. In these examples we select networks and dataset sizes that give reasonable computation time, while still capturing the main idea of the methods and results. Please feel free to submit suggestions or contribute code that will recreate the results of your own papers (send these to `jruths@utdallas.edu <mailto:jruths@utdallas.edu>`_).

We hope these files will also serve as a useful tutorial to get started with netcontrolz. The scripts that reproduce the publication results are located under the ``pubs`` directory within the netcontrolz repository.
